        Findora integrates a{" "}
        <span className=" font-bold">growing ecosystem</span> of intelligent
        modules that span web search, fact-check validation, URL and document
        analysis, academic and medical insights, video and multimedia search,
        and soon, shopping intelligence. In addition, it introduces: <br />
        <span className=" font-bold">• ARTA,</span> a real-time deepfake
        detection system for verifying the authenticity of audio and video
        content. <br />
        <span className=" font-bold">• DANA,</span> an AI companion focused on
        cognitive support, emotional well-being, and life organization.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to Statistic Canada, in 2023{" "}
        <span className=" font-bold">59% of Canadians</span> reported being{" "}
        <span className=" font-bold">very concerned</span> about misinformation
        on the internet. Moreover, 43% felt that it had become harder to discern
        truth from falsehood compared to{" "}
        <span className=" font-bold">just three years</span> prior.
        <br />
        <br />
        “We created Findora to help people rise above the noise and find answers
        they can actually trust,” says Dr. Naeem Komeilipoor, Founder and CEO of
        Findora. “{"It’s"} more than a search engine. {"It’s"} a movement toward
        verified knowledge, privacy, and digital dignity.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Built and hosted entirely in Canada, Findora reflects Canadian values of
        <span className=" font-bold"> privacy, scientific integrity,</span> and
        <span className=" font-bold"> bilingual inclusivity,</span> supporting
        both English and French users.
        <br />
        <br />
        While the platform is freely available to the public, Findora also
        operates a <span className=" font-bold">
          hybrid business model,
        </span>{" "}
        offering <span className=" font-bold">enterprise solutions</span> for
        organizations such as media outlets, research institutions, legal firms,
        and healthcare providers. These clients can integrate {"Findora’s"}{" "}
        modules directly into their workflows, elevating the accuracy and
        transparency of their operations.
        <br />
        <br />
        As part of its long-term vision, Findora is currently training its own
        <span className=" font-bold"> proprietary language model</span> to
        enhance contextual understanding, reduce hallucinations, and deliver
        even deeper domain-specific knowledge.
